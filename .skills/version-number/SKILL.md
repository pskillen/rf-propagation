  Display build environment and version in page footers for the Propagation
  Viewer SPA. Covers Vite define injection at build time, local fallbacks, and
  footer UI. Use when adding build info, wiring deploy workflows, or debugging
  which release a tab is running.

# Build version and environment in footer

Propagation Viewer displays **build environment** and **build version** in a
muted page footer, following the same pattern as its sibling project,
Codeplug Studio. Values are baked in at **build time** via Vite `define` in
`vite.config.ts`. Local dev builds fall back to `"local"` without
configuration.

Pair with [git-workflow](../git-workflow/SKILL.md) for releases.

**Note:** none of this exists yet — this skill describes the pattern to
implement once the app is scaffolded (bootstrap checklist item), so a fresh
agent doesn't have to reinvent it or drift from the sibling project's
convention.

## Layout (once scaffolded)

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `vite.config.ts` | `define` for `__BUILD_ENV__` / `__BUILD_VERSION__` |
| `src/vite-env.d.ts` | Global declarations |
| `src/app/components/BuildFooter/BuildFooter.tsx` | Footer UI |
| `src/app/App.tsx` | Mounts footer on every route |
| `.github/workflows/cloudflare-pages.yaml` | Reusable build + deploy |
| `.github/workflows/prod.yaml` | Prod env on full release |
| `.github/workflows/staging.yaml` | Staging env on pre-release |
| `.github/workflows/main.yaml` | Main env on push to `main` (CF preview branch `next`) |
| `.github/workflows/dev.yaml` | Dev env on push to `dev` |

Site base path: `/`.

---

## Values

| Environment | `BUILD_ENV` | `BUILD_VERSION` | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| local | `local` | `local` | `npm run dev` |
| next (continuous) | `main` | commit SHA | push to `main` → CF branch `next` |
| dev | `dev` | commit SHA | push to `dev` |
| staging | `staging` | SemVer from tag (leading `v` stripped) | pre-release publish |
| prod | `prod` | SemVer from tag (leading `v` stripped) | full release publish |

**Prod is deliberately not wired up until the physics validation harness and
VOACAP goldens exist** — see the product planning doc set. Until then, only
`local` / `dev` / `next` need to work.

---

## Local smoke test

```bash
npm run dev          # footer: local · local
BUILD_ENV=prod BUILD_VERSION=v0.1.0 npm run build && npm run preview
BUILD_ENV=main BUILD_VERSION=abc1234 npm run build && npm run preview
```

---

## Deploy workflows

Build env is set in `.github/workflows/cloudflare-pages.yaml`:

```yaml
env:
  BUILD_ENV: ${{ inputs.build_env }}
  BUILD_VERSION: ${{ inputs.build_version }}
```

After publishing a full release, verify footer on `https://propagation.mm9pdy.net` shows `prod · <semver>`.
