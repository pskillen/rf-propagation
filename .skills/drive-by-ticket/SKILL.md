# Drive-by ticket (rf-propagation)

Ship a GitHub issue as a **PR opened after local confidence checks** — no Cursor plan file, no plan mode. Do **not** babysit remote CI to green before handing back.

**Invocation:** paste issue number + title, then `@drive-by-ticket` and submit.

```text
#42 Add scan-slider transport control to the Reach surface
@drive-by-ticket
```

Repo: `pskillen/rf-propagation`. Use **`github-personal`** MCP for issues and PRs — not `gh`, and not any other GitHub MCP.

**Read first:** [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).

**Sibling skills:** [git-workflow](../git-workflow/SKILL.md), [feature-docs](../feature-docs/SKILL.md), [progress-tracking](../progress-tracking/SKILL.md). For planning only, use [make-a-plan](../make-a-plan/SKILL.md).

## What this skill does vs make-a-plan

| Step | make-a-plan | drive-by-ticket |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Pull issue + explore code | Yes | Yes |
| Write a Cursor plan file | Yes | **No** |
| Require plan mode | Yes | **No** |
| Branch + atomic commits | At execution | Yes |
| Docs + progress files | At execution | Feature docs always when needed; progress only if handoff likely |
| Open PR | At execution | Yes |
| Babysit CI to green | Optional follow-up | **No** — return after PR open; user asks if CI fails |

Work breakdown stays **in conversation** (TodoWrite or a short mental slice list). Do not create plan files.

---

## Exit criterion

Done when **all** are true:

1. Branch pushed; PR open in `pskillen/rf-propagation` with `Closes #N`.
2. Local gate passed (when `package.json` exists and the change touches code): `npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build` — enough that CI is **reasonably likely** to pass. Docs/skills-only changes: skip inapplicable npm scripts.
3. No known unresolved review threads from this session that require code changes before handoff (if reviews already exist).
4. Documentation deliverables satisfied — see [feature-docs](../feature-docs/SKILL.md).

**Do not** wait for PR check runs to go green before returning. Return the **PR URL** as soon as the exit criterion above is met. Assume the user will ask for a follow-up if CI fails.

---

## 1. Gather context

Parse issue number from the user message (`#42`, `42`, `rf-propagation#42`).

1. `issue_read` (`method: get`, `owner: pskillen`, `repo: rf-propagation`).
2. `issue_read` (`method: get_comments`) when the body is thin or discussion is recent.
3. `issue_read` (`method: get_sub_issues`) for epics/parents — if children exist, **stop** and ask whether to ship the parent, one child, or switch to [make-a-plan](../make-a-plan/SKILL.md).

Summarise: problem, intended outcome, affected layers (`src/core/`, `src/app/`, `docs/`), linked docs, open questions.

Explore the codebase before coding. Prefer existing patterns.

Check existing execution logs **when present** (do not create new ones for small tickets):

- `docs/features/<topic>/*-progress.md` / `*-outstanding.md`
- Feature READMEs under `docs/features/<topic>/`

### Clarify blockers only

Use **AskQuestion** when material ambiguity would cause wrong-layer work or scope creep. Do **not** block on writing a plan — resolve or explicitly defer in PR **Out of scope**.

### Physics/engine changes

If the ticket touches the propagation engine, note in the PR which validation-harness cases (once the harness exists) were run, and whether the change makes any new physical claim that needs a new check. Do not treat round-trip/system tests as a substitute.

---

## 2. Branch and slice the work

`get_me` for GitHub login → branch author segment.

**Branch:** `{num}/{author}/{short-slug}` from `origin/main` via `create_branch` or local git.

**Shell:** set `working_directory` to the rf-propagation repo root for all git commands. Use `required_permissions: ["git_write"]`; add `"network"` for fetch/push.

### Internal slices (no plan file)

Break work into **2–5 committable slices** in a TodoWrite list or short bullet list. Each slice ends with a **commit checkpoint** before the next slice starts.

| Scope | Slices | Progress files |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Single-file / small single-phase | 1–3 | **Skip** |
| Small feature, one session, one PR | 2–3 | **Skip** unless handoff risk appears |
| Epic / multi-day / multi-agent / multi-PR | Prefer [make-a-plan](../make-a-plan/SKILL.md); if continuing here | **Required** — [progress-tracking](../progress-tracking/SKILL.md) |

Progress/outstanding files carry context across multi-plan / multi-agent / multi-day work. Most `@drive-by-ticket` runs are small and single-phase — **do not create them**. If the ticket grows mid-flight, start the pair then.

Example slice list (in chat, not a file):

```text
- [ ] Slice 1: engine change + tests → commit
- [ ] Slice 2: app UI wiring → commit
- [ ] Slice 3: feature docs + sidecar → commit
```

---

## 3. Execute — commit as you go (non-negotiable)

This skill **overrides** "commit only when the user asks". Commit at **every slice checkpoint** without waiting for the user.

At each checkpoint:

1. Run slice-relevant checks (`npm run lint`, `npm run test`, …).
2. Stage only files for the completed slice.
3. Create an **atomic conventional commit** (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, …) per [git-workflow](../git-workflow/SKILL.md).
4. Update progress/outstanding docs **only when this initiative already uses them** (or just created them for handoff risk).
5. `git status -sb` — working tree clean before the next slice.

**Forbidden:** batching many edits then one commit at PR time.

If a slice spans docs + code, prefer **two commits** when logically separable.

After any long pause or handoff summary: `git log -5` and `git status -sb` — do not assume prior commits landed.

---

## 4. Documentation

Ship documentation in the **same PR** as behaviour — not deferred.

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| New or changed feature behaviour | [feature-docs](../feature-docs/SKILL.md) — hub README, deep dives, `docs/features/README.md` index |
| Multi-plan / multi-agent / multi-day / multi-PR (handoff likely) | [progress-tracking](../progress-tracking/SKILL.md) — progress + outstanding pair |
| Small single-phase ticket | No progress files |
| New reusable component under `src/app/components/` | Sidecar `<ComponentName>.md` next to the component |

Docs are their own slice with their own commit checkpoint when non-trivial.

---

## 5. Pre-PR local gate

Before push, be **reasonably confident** CI will pass:

1. `npm run format` — commit Prettier fixes (`chore: format` or fold into last slice).
2. When applicable: `npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build`.
3. `npm run dev` — smoke affected route(s) when behaviour changed.
4. Engine changes: run the physics validation harness (once it exists).
5. Confirm no secrets or personal location data staged.
6. If this initiative uses progress files, update them with branch name and verify steps.

Docs/skills-only PRs: skip npm scripts that do not apply; still push only when the diff is coherent and reviewable.

---

## 6. Open PR

1. Push branch (`git push -u origin HEAD`, `network` permission).
2. `create_pull_request` in `pskillen/rf-propagation`.
3. Body — use [git-workflow PR template](../git-workflow/SKILL.md#6-pull-requests); include `Closes #N`.
4. `add_issue_comment` on the issue with PR link (optional but helpful).
5. Return the **PR URL** — **do not** poll check runs or block on green CI.

---

## 7. After handoff (only if the user asks)

Do **not** enter a CI babysit loop by default. If the user reports red CI or asks to fix checks:

1. **CI:** `pull_request_read` (`method: get_check_runs`, `method: get_status`). Reproduce locally when possible; fix within PR scope; push.
2. If branch may be behind `main`, `update_pull_request_branch` then re-check.
3. Never weaken CI config just to pass.
4. For opaque CI failures, use **ci-investigator** subagent on the failing check.
5. **Comments:** `get_review_comments` — fix valid Bugbot/human findings; reply when disagreeing.
6. **Conflicts:** resolve intelligently; if intent conflicts with `main`, ask the user.

## Anti-patterns

- Creating a Cursor plan file — use [make-a-plan](../make-a-plan/SKILL.md) instead.
- Creating progress/outstanding files for a small single-phase ticket.
- Skipping progress files when multi-plan / multi-agent / multi-day continuation is likely.
- Executing from issue title alone without `issue_read` and code exploration.
- One giant commit before PR.
- Deferring feature docs to a follow-up PR for the same behaviour.
- Waiting on remote CI before returning the PR URL after a solid local gate.
- Pushing without running the applicable local format / lint / test / build checks when code changed.
- Using `gh` CLI or any GitHub MCP other than `github-personal` (not available/not permitted).

## Quick reference

```text
User: #N Title + @drive-by-ticket
  → issue_read + explore
  → branch {N}/{author}/{slug}
  → slices with atomic commits
  → docs in same PR
  → local format:check + lint + test + build (as applicable)
  → push + create_pull_request (Closes #N)
  → return PR URL (do not wait for CI)
  → fix CI only if user asks
```
